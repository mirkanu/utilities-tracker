# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-09)

**Core value:** See at a glance how much oil and electricity you're using, know when the oil will run out, and never miss an electricity contract renewal — all from your phone.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 4 (Foundation)
Plan: 0 of ? in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-05-09 — Roadmap created (4 phases, 20 requirements mapped)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 1: Use DATE columns (not TIMESTAMP) for all reading dates; set TZ=Europe/London in Docker Compose from day one — cannot be cheaply changed after data exists
- Phase 1: Use iron-session (encrypted cookie) for auth; no session table needed
- Phase 1: Create postgres.js client singleton in lib/db/client.ts (max: 5 connections) to prevent pool exhaustion
- Phase 2: Oil depletion prediction uses only readings since last purchase (segment-based) — naive all-time slope breaks silently on refill events
- Phase 2: Require at least 2 readings since last purchase before showing any depletion prediction

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Brute-force protection approach not yet decided: (1) Cloudflare Access IP restriction (recommended, zero app code) or (2) in-app rate limiting in PostgreSQL. Decide before Phase 1 starts.
- UTILITIES_SESSION_SECRET must be generated (`openssl rand -base64 32`) and added to /home/services/.env.production before first deploy.
